# Exhaustive Attractor detection in Logical Multivalued Regulatory Netowrks

The class computes the node and cyclic attractors in a multivalued regulatory graph exhaustively.
It simulates the time evolution of the network and forms a so called State Transition Graph (STG) that could be traveresed to detect cyclic and node attractors.
An attractor is a set of state(s) where once the system enters them, stays there indefinitely. 
The attractors are closely related to Strongly Connected Components in a graph but without any outdegrees.
